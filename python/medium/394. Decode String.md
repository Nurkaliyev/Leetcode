# 394. Decode String

Given an encoded string, return its decoded string.

The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly k times. Note that k is guaranteed to be a positive integer.

You may assume that the input string is always valid; there are no extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc. Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, k. For example, there will not be input like 3a or 2[4].

The test cases are generated so that the length of the output will never exceed 10^5.

# Examples
- <strong> Example 1: </strong> 
- <strong> Input: </strong> s = "3[a]2[bc]" 
- <strong> Output: </strong> "aaabcbc" 

___

- <strong> Example 2: </strong> 
- <strong> Input: </strong> s = "3[a2[c]]" 
- <strong> Output: </strong> "accaccacc" 

___

- <strong> Example 3: </strong> 
- <strong> Input: </strong>  s = "2[abc]3[cd]ef" 
- <strong> Output: </strong> "abcabccdcdcdef"

# Constraints:
- 1 <= s.length <= 30
- s consists of lowercase English letters, digits, and square brackets '[]'.
- s is guaranteed to be a valid input.
- All the integers in s are in the range [1, 300].

# Code
```python
class Solution:
    def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:
```

# Solution

## Version 1
```python
class Solution:
    def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:
        k = 0  # Initialize the repetition factor to zero
        current_string = ''  # Initialize the current string to an empty string
        stack = []  # Initialize the stack to an empty list

        for char in s:  # Iterate through each character in the input string
            if char.isdigit():  # If the character is a digit, update the repetition factor
                k = k * 10 + int(char)
            elif char.isalpha():  # If the character is a letter, add it to the current string
                current_string += char
            elif char == '[':  # If the character is an opening bracket, push the current string and repetition factor onto the stack
                stack.append((current_string, k))
                k = 0  # Reset the repetition factor to zero
                current_string = ''  # Reset the current string to an empty string
            elif char == ']':  # If the character is a closing bracket, pop the top tuple from the stack and update the current string
                last_char, last_k = stack.pop(-1)
                current_string = last_char + last_k * current_string

        return current_string  # Return the decoded string

```
