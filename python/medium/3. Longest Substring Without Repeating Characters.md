# 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Given a string s, find the length of the longest
substring without repeating characters.

# Examples
- <strong> Example 1: </strong> \
- <strong> Input: </strong> s = "abcabcbb" \
- <strong> Output: </strong> 3 \
- <strong> Explanation: </strong> The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.


- <strong> Example 2: </strong> \
- <strong> Input: </strong> s = "bbbbb" \
- <strong> Output: </strong> 1
- <strong> Explanation: </strong> The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

- <strong> Example 3: </strong> \
- <strong> Input: </strong>  s = "pwwkew" \
- <strong> Output: </strong> 3
- <strong> Explanation: </strong> The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

# Constraints:
- 0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4 
- s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

# Code
```python
class Solution:
        def lengthOfLongestSubstring_version1(self, s: str) -> int:
```

# Solution

## Version 1
```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        # set to store characters in current substring
        char_set = set()
        # initialize max length
        max_len = 0
        # initialize start and end pointers
        start = 0
        end = 0
        # loop until end pointer reaches end of string
        while end < len(s):
            # if current character not in char_set
            if s[end] not in char_set:
                # add current character to char_set and update max_len if necessary
                char_set.add(s[end])
                end += 1
                max_len = max(max_len, end - start)
            else:
                # if current character is already in char_set, remove characters from start until current character is removed
                char_set.remove(s[start])
                start += 1
        # return max length
        return max_len
```

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
$$O(n)$$

- Space complexity:
$$O(k)$$

## Version 2
```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        # dictionary to store characters and their indices in current substring
        char_dict = {}
        # initialize max length
        max_len = 0
        # initialize start of current substring
        start = 0
        # loop through string
        for end, char in enumerate(s):
            # if char already in char_dict, update start to index of char + 1
            if char in char_dict:
                start = max(start, char_dict[char] + 1)
            # update char_dict with char and its index
            char_dict[char] = end
            # update max_len if necessary
            max_len = max(max_len, end - start + 1)
        # return max length
        return max_len
```
