# 1. Two Sum
Given an array of integers numsÂ and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.


# Examples
-<strong> Example 1: </strong> \
 <strong> Input: </strong> nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9 \
 <strong> Output: </strong> [0,1] \
 <strong> Explanation: </strong> Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1]. 


-<strong> Example 2: </strong> \
 <strong> Input: </strong> nums = [3,2,4], target = 6 \
 <strong> Output: </strong> [1,2] 


-<strong> Example 3: </strong> \
<strong> Input: </strong> nums = [3,3], target = 6 \
<strong> Output: </strong> [0,1] 

# Code
```python
from typing import List
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
```

# Solution
```python
class Solution:
    # 1. Two Sum
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        # Create a dictionary to store the indices of the elements
        indices = {}

        # Loop through the list of numbers
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            # Check if the target minus the current number is in the dictionary
            if target - num in indices:
                # If it is, return the indices of the pair of numbers
                return [indices[target - num], i]

            # Otherwise, add the current number and its index to the dictionary
            indices[num] = i

        # If we didn't find a pair of numbers, return an empty list
        return []
```
